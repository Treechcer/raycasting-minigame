# Code / math / etc

This game uses and translates the code from C with OpenGL from [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA) (link to the first episode) from [3DSage (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/@3DSage).

# Raycasting mini-game

This game will be DOOM (1993) inspired, I'm planning to add more things than there're now, but I might not be able to added anything much in near future. The game has no name YET and when it'll be closer to finish I'll make for it some name at lease decent one.
